## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

Blissful Blends, is an application that allows a user to explore the array of different types of Cannabis Strains! Using the Weed Strains API, On Load you'll be taken to the home page where you are able to filter for sativa, indica, or hybrid strains, or if you prefer you can look through the entire library. After clicking a strain type the user is able to scroll through the Strains.  Users are able to Save their strain favorites to their matching library, found in the header.   

The app incorporates a responsive layout and will change its structure to fit both large and mobile displays. It was built using functional React Hooks, Controlled form pattern, Typscript, and  React Router.  


 In the near future, I plan to add  End-To-End Testing using Cypress where fetch requests are stubbed with fixtures and sad paths are tested to ensure intended execution. I plan to add more industry styled CSS. Finally I would like to add a landing page that gives facts on the different strains, and then an individual view that gives more specific details of each individual strain. I'd finally like to be able to filter through the strains, based on their positive effects.
  
I hope you have fun using Blissful Blends!!
